*MUChToSee*

Inspiration

Use Data provided by the city of munich to help tourists and locals get to know the city better or discover hidden places
What it does

Depending on available time by the group and their startpoint, a custom track with restaurants, museums, bars and churches will be generated.
How I built it

We built it in two different ways, just to be sure it works.
Challenges I ran into

Finding an algorithm to match the time requirements with different stations
Accomplishments that I'm proud of
What I learned

A lot about maps
What's next for MUChToSee

Fix everything that doesn't work. Integrate with other Munich services, like the Radroutenplane
